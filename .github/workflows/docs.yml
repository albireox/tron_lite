    # There is no immediate way to deploy multiple versions to GH Pages but
    # it should be simple to deploy PR and tags to a directory structure such
    # as versions/<tag>/ by changing the FOLDER parameter in the Deploy.
    # We'll need to add that folder to CLEAN_EXCLUDE. To remove versions it
    # would need to be done manually.
